I am writing a swift IOS app in ./ios. I am losely basing it off of the react-natige project in ./frontend
Use default SwiftUI styling including icons etc.
Write comments assuming I am an expert in React but 6 don't know anything about Swift.
Write comments documenting user behaviours.
Write tests when appropriate. When writing tests, ensure you comment what behaviour you are testing for. If there are no appropriate test, don't write one. Only write relevant BDD tests that match user workflows in the app. Do not run any tests, I will run them myself to validate.
Ensure the codebase is as DRY as **reasonably** possible.

Implement the sync layer from ./frontend. You can see the sync endpoints in ./backend. I forgot how the implementation works. Remind me, ask loads of quesions if things can be implemented differently.

I need this to work cross platform, in future I will have an android app and a web app so i cannot rely on icloud store (I think).

- The user needs to be able to use the app on their platform without an account. In this case there will be no sync.
- If they have an account, then all of their data must be synced.

# Settings page

Auth, do not just show a spinner if the network request fails.

# Rewards

Implement the Rewards page. There are subtle differences in the Reward type. It should resemble closely the Habits. Ensure the abstractions are enforced such that the codebase is extremely DRY. Make this local-only for now, do not implement the local-first sync layer sound in the old project.

Add the price

Also ensure that this pill scroll correctly conveys the case where there is overflow.
