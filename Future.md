I am writing a swift IOS app in ./ios. I am losely basing it off of the react-natige project in ./frontend
Use default SwiftUI styling including icons etc.
Write comments assuming I am an expert in React but 6 don't know anything about Swift.
Write comments documenting user behaviours.
Write tests when appropriate. When writing tests, ensure you comment what behaviour you are testing for. If there are no appropriate test, don't write one. Only write relevant BDD tests that match user workflows in the app. Do not run any tests, I will run them myself to validate.
Ensure the codebase is as DRY as **reasonably** possible.

Remove the trades page. Make the balance in the top right be a liquid glass button that opens a new modal from the bottom .large that lists all trades. See the implementation of the trades page in ./frontend to see the information i want to display on the list of trades. 

# Filters

Filters

# Settings page

Auth, do not just show a spinner if the network request fails.

# Rewards

Implement the Rewards page. There are subtle differences in the Reward type. It should resemble closely the Habits. Ensure the abstractions are enforced such that the codebase is extremely DRY. Make this local-only for now, do not implement the local-first sync layer sound in the old project.

# Trades

# NEXT

Add the price

Also ensure that this pill scroll correctly conveys the case where there is overflow.
